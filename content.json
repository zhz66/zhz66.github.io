Or copy down sudo apt install git git clone https://github.com/norse/norse cd norse pipXXX install -e . You must to attention a detail . after e. Question3: How do you deal with the lack of your VMWARE’s store ? approach1：delete somethings，and balabal. approach2 : 打开虚拟机设置，点击硬盘，扩充容量，开机之后进入终端输入以下命令: sudo apt-get install gparted sudo gparted 安装之后你就可以通过gparted扩展分区了，如果你想扩充20G的分区，你需要将 dev/fsda2/下面的swap分区先OFF,右键某一个分区，点击XXX/XX的选项，然后就可以随意滑动分区。 原理就是磁盘从左到右是地址递增的，存储盘块就是连续的地址，你想要多少分区分配多少地址就行。","categories":[],"tags":[]},{"title":"Spiking Notes(1)","slug":"Spiking-Notes-1","date":"2020-02-22T07:48:20.000Z","updated":"2020-02-22T16:56:15.062Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/02/22/Spiking-Notes-1/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2020/02/22/Spiking-Notes-1/","excerpt":"","text":"神经网络模型历史第一代 The first generation is based on McCulloch-Pitts neurons as computational units. These are also referred to as perceptrons or threshold gates.they can only give digital output. In fact they are universal for computations with digital input and output, and every boolean function can be computed by some multilayer perceptron with a single hidden layer.第二代（ANN） The second generation is based on computational units that apply an “activation function” with a continuous set of possible output values to a weighted sum (or polynomial) of the inputs.The second generation can compute certain boolean functions with fewer gates than neural nets from the first generation. In addition, neural nets from the second generation are able to compute functions with analog input and output. Another characteristic feature of this second generation of neural network models is that they support learning algorithms that are based on gradient descent such as backprop.However, at least with regard to fast analog computations by networks of neurons in the cortex, the “firing rate interpretation” itself has become questionable. 第三代（SNN） Many biological neural systems use the timing of single action potentials (or “spikes”) to encode information.A third generation of neuralnetwork models which employ spiking neurons (or “integrate-and-fire neurons”) as computational units. 脉冲神经网络基础知识：1The timing of individual computation steps plays a key role for computations in networks of spiking neurons. 2In the simplest (deterministic) model of a spiking neuron one assumes that a neuron v fires whenever its \"potential\" Pv (which models the electric membrane potential at the \"trigger zone\" of neuron v) reaches a certain threshold ®v. This potential Pv is the sum of so-called excitatory postsynaptic potentials (\"EPSPs\") and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (\"IPSPs\"), which result from the firing of other neurons u that are connected through a \"synapse\" to neuron v. 3突触前神经元U在s时刻的放电对于t时刻Pv的影响（贡献）由以下算式决定：Wu,v · Qu，v（t-s）。权重Wu，v≥0, Qu,v(t-s)是响应函数。权重Wu，v代表神经元u与v之间突触的效能。 4.历史上第一个正式的SNN模型的要素：有限个数的脉冲神经元集合V；神经元突触集合E（V×V）；一个权重Wu，v ≥0；一个响应函数Qu，v（针对那些属于E并且权重大于0的突触设置的）；一个阈值函数Hv。 5.阈值函数图像: 6.第一个正式的SNN模型中的Pv公式:","categories":[],"tags":[]},{"title":"my_first_article","slug":"my-first-article","date":"2019-09-17T11:36:57.000Z","updated":"2020-02-17T15:41:44.512Z","comments":true,"path":"2019/09/17/my-first-article/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2019/09/17/my-first-article/","excerpt":"","text":"Quick StartCreate a new post1$ hexo new \"My New Post\" More info: 同一个机器安装多个Python3版本，pip共存 Quick StartCreate a new post1$ hexo new \"My New Post\" Quick StartCreate a new post1$ hexo new \"My New Post\"","categories":[],"tags":[]},{"title":"Hello World","slug":"hello-world","date":"2019-09-17T11:20:13.649Z","updated":"2019-09-17T11:20:13.650Z","comments":true,"path":"2019/09/17/hello-world/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2019/09/17/hello-world/","excerpt":"","text":"Welcome to Hexo!
